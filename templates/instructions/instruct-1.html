		    You will study alien words paired with unusual objects on a series of slides. Your goal is to try to remember which words refer to which objects. Please do not cheat (for example, by writing anything down or by using screenshots). 
	    </p>

        <p>
        After the study period, you will be asked which object goes with each word.
